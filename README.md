MCFR_HyS_BOP.mo
- Explanation: This is the completed IES dynamic model of the MCFR powering a Hybrid Sulfur cycle for hydrogen production and a Regenerative Rankine cycle for electricity production. Requires the OMEdit OpenModelica Connection Editor to run or similar.

"IES Results"
- Explanation: The output data and plots for different transients and accident scenarios.

"Individual Models (BETA)"
- Explanation: The three systems (MCFR, HyS, and RBOP) as their own individual models. These files were made when developing the models. The complete IES model with the most refinement, features, and comments is MCFR_HyS_BOP.mo 

"Scripts for bulk submission"
- Explanation: The files necessary for running the model numerous times with a slight modification. These were used for the frequency response analysis, which required 450 runs with a variable modified.
