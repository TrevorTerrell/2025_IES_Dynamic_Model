"individualModels(BETA)"
- Explanation: The three systems (MCFR, HyS, and RBOP) as their own individual models. 
These files were made when developing the models. The complete IES model with the most refinement, 
features, and comments is MCFR_HyS_BOP.mo 

"results.zip"
- Explanation: The output data and plots for different transients and accident scenarios.

"scripts"
- Explanation: The files necessary for bulk-running the model numerous times with a slight modification. 
These were used for the frequency response analysis, which required 450 runs with a variable modified.

"MCFR_HyS_BOP.mo"
- Explanation: This is the completed IES dynamic model of the MCFR powering a Hybrid Sulfur cycle for 
hydrogen production and a Regenerative Rankine cycle for electricity production. Requires the OMEdit 
OpenModelica Connection Editor to run or similar.
